## Graph Explanation
"spg_large_fmeasure.jpg" is the F-measure of our method, logistic classification and BS methods;

"spg_large_time.jpg" is the excution time of comparing our method to logistic classification and BS methods;

"spg_compare.jpg" is the excution time of comparing our method to some existing bilevel optimization methods;

"spg_sto1.jpg" is the excution time of our method in the stochastic setting;

"spg_sto2.jpg" is the excution time of comparing our method to some existing stochastic bilevel optimization methods.
